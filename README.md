# GDLS ReOrdering System

A lightweight app for tracking and ordering required materials. Import data from .csv files and check for daily updates via cron job. Reporting via .csv export.

## Usage
Clone to the location of your choice, run NPM install and you should be done for front end. Import the DB to the back-end framework of your choice (we use my SQL) and edit configuration accordingly.

## Dev Stack
Node, Express, mySQL, Vue and (mostly) vanilla JavaScript. We use the module pattern and component-based architecture in our builds. 
We use SASS on the front end for CSS.
